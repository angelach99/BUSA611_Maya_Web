# BUSA611_Maya_Web

Hello! This is the repository for the BUSA611 Independent Study Project -- Maya Maypoint Website Project with Autodesk. You can find detailed documentation, data, and scripts I created for the backend of the website. 

## Pain Point & Objective
The Maya team currently is lacking a centralized tool where internal stakeholders such as project managers (PM) can easily determine if data that they need is available without complex querying. To deliver a proof of concept stage of website that generates important Maya data points for internal users. These data points can be used to product usage information that could be used to help improve product quality and understand customersâ€™ needs better. Therefore, the goal is to provide an easy to use platform to quickly access data availability without complex querying.
